I have given the model file with the appropiate word2vec and scaler files so you can predict easier.
But the problem is that the model is trained with extra features in mind so if you want to use the model, you need to use the same features.
I already listed all the features in the report I have sent but you can also you data preprocessing code and the feature extraction code to see the features.
You can use those notebooks to read any more json files and predict the final and midterm grades.
I wasnt sure if you wanted us to provide a file that will do that for you aswell but I thought it would be hard and you would still needed to run a notebook to do that.

The code I provided you is not the whole thing becasuse of the 20 file limit but I have uploaded all theses files into a repo right here: https://github.com/tlhakbulut/BIL471_HW
